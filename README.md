# exploitDB-hardware: Exploring the characteristics of hardware exploits listed on exploitDB
## Introduction
This workbook analyzes data on hardware exploits from the [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com), which is an extensive database of various kinds of publicly released exploits.

## Data
As of 4 Feb 2019 there were 1,568 such exploits listed in the database. Each exploit entry contains the following information: date of release, type (e.g. if it affects webapps, OS, etc.), the author, the title (the product the exploit affects and the consequences/impact) and its platform (in this case all are 'hardware' though the ExploitDB contains exploits that affect other platforms).  

## Goals and variables explored
This work is part of an ongoing project with the [Center for Democracy and Technology](www.cdt.org), which explores the concept of 'digital defects'.
