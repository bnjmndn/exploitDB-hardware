# exploitDB-hardware: Exploring the characteristics of hardware exploits listed on exploitDB
## Introduction
This workbook analyzes data on hardware exploits from the [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com), which is an extensive database of various kinds of publicly released exploits.

## Data
As of 4 Feb 2019 there were 1,568 such exploits listed in the database. Each exploit entry contains the following information: date of release, type (e.g. if it affects webapps, OS, etc.), the author, the title (the product the exploit affects and the consequences/impact) and its platform (in this case all are 'hardware' though the ExploitDB contains exploits that affect other platforms).  

## Goals and variables explored
This work is part of an ongoing project with the [Center for Democracy and Technology](www.cdt.org), which explores the concept of 'digital defects'. 

Hardware exploits are of interest because they reveal the frequency of known flaws in different types of hardware. They also reveal the probability of certain consequences from exploitation of these flaws. This helps us think through more clearly what flaws could be considered most serious given the frequency with which they are found and what kinds of consequences can/could/should be expected from future discovery. This might help parse out flaws that could be considered defects - in the sense that either they should be identifiable ex ante, given their historical frquency, or given the seriousness of their consequences - from those that should not. We also get an idea of which companies and products are most likely to be subject to litigation for flaws in the future given the frequency of flaws that have appeared in their products in the past.
